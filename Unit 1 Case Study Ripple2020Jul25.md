# Ripple is the Amazon of Global Payments, Fast and Cheap:  2 hour delivery and free shipping
## Overview and Origin:
* Name of company: Ripple
* When was the company incorporated? Ripple Labs was founded in September 26, 2013.  The San Francisco startup focused on security, simplicity, and speed, and to bring money transfers into the 21st century.  Bitcoin was very popular at the time but could take hours to process since it used a peer-to-peer system.  Ripple wanted to make a new and improved bitcoin which can process transactions the way VISA.
* Who are the founders of the company? Ripple is the marriage of 3 individuals.  Fugger provided the exchange technology, McCaleb provided the cryptocurrency, and Larsen provided the initial capital.  In other words, Platform + XRP cryptocurrency + USD Cash = Ripple.  Ryan Fugger built the first version of RipplePay.com which is a decentralized payment exchange network, versus a centralized system.  Jed McCaleb, a well-known programmer developed a digital currency system that is verifiable by members on the network, instead of the Bitcoin's mining process.  Chris Larsen, who is considered the richest person in cryptocurrency, provided the initial investment.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? Since information can move all over the world quickly and easily with an email, then why can't the same be done with money?  The average Ripple transaction time is 4 seconds, compared to a few days for traditional banking systems.
* How is the company funded? They raise funding through institutional investors and venture capital.
* How much funding have they received? Since Ripple was founded, it has participated in 6 rounds of funding.  In total Ripple has raised $290.5 million.  Ripple's latest funding round was on December 2019 for $200 million.
## Business Activities:
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 
Ripple created a payment network like SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) who performs the settlement and actual movement of money for banks.  SWIFT currently asks as the middleman within the banking infrastructure, and subject to strict regulations.  Also, the SWIFT network is far from efficient.  Why should banks accept a trade-off between speed and cost?  Banks wants a solution that has it all:  trustworthy, reliable, fast and cheap.  

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Institutional payment-providers such as banks and money services businesses who need to make international transactions worldwide were the intended customer.
* Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? SWIFT currently has a membership size of 10,000 financial institutions.  RippleNet, currently includes just over 300 financial institutions across 40 countries and six continents.  There is certainly room for Ripple to grow.
* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) The traditional bank customers were unsatisfied with expensive fees when sending money abroad, as well as slow speeds of each transaction.  Ripple's blockchain-powered technology and global network of institutions allows customers to see exactly how much will arrive, while the low-cost transactions happen instantly or on the same day instead of the traditional time 3-5 days.  Basically, banks can move large sums of money at faster speeds and at a fraction of the cost.  
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? Ripple uses an iterative consensus ledger and validating server networks along with XRP cryptocurrency tokens.  The patented technology is called the Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA).  The Ripple network is managed by a range of independent servers comparing their transaction records constantly.  The XRP Ledger was independently created from Ripple, so Ripple does NOT control or own it.  What is unique about Ripple is that it owns its own currency (XRP), but also allows everybody to use the platform.  Ripple has the ability to be exchange any currency with minimal commissions.  For example, banks need to use the US dollar as a mediator.  So there is a double commission:  converting currency A to USD and USD to currency B.  Ripple is a mediator too, but much cheaper than the USD. 
## Landscape:
* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? In the financial industry, the company of Ripple is in the Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies domain.  They are looking to rule that domain with about a third of the worlds largests banks testing or putting to use the fast and cheap RippleNet gateways.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? When Blockchain and digital assets (cryptocurrency) was first introduced, it was thought be a technology experiment.  Now it is disturbing several industries such as contracts, notary services, stocks and bonds.  Basically, anywhere you need a trusted third party to verify a transaction.  Acceptance is a slow process, since several parties need to trust this process such as regulators, financial institutions, consumers and suppliers.  Most consumers and suppliers still do not understand what is cryptocurrency or how it can be used to purchase goods.  As they become more familiar with using cryptocurrency for basic transactions, credit-card transactions may decrease.  Banks were the traditional way customers accessed their money, but with the rise of Apple Pay and Google Pay, financial institutions have had to evolve with alternatives for consumers, such as Zelle.  People are becoming more protective of their privacy.  Businesses need to overcome the challenge of application of laws, taxes, and whether a contract is enforceable.  Several countries in the European Union and United Arab Emirates have national policies/strategies that could make people feel safe.

* What are the other major companies in this domain? Some of the biggest rivals of Ripple is Bitcoin, Ethereum, and SWIFT.  Other platforms similar to Ripple are Stellar, OmiseGO, and Nano.  Yet, due to their strong financial industry adoption, XRP is the third most valuable cryptocurrency by markey cap at $90 billion in January of 2018.
## Results:
* What has been the business impact of this company so far? Ripple's technology allows banks to compete with other payment providers.  The legacy SWIFT network is now piloting their own blockchain service.  The payment giant VISA (who can process 20 thousand transactions per second) is also piloting blockchain solutions.  More competition is great, especially for end users since the lower cost can be passed on to consumers. The biggest impact I see is that innovation by Ripple, plus other companies will eventually benefit consumers.  

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? The core metrics that major companies in this domain use to measure success is through the average transaction time and the transaction fee.  
* How is your company performing, based on these metrics? Ripple is currently a top performer of both these metrics having an average transaction time of 4 seconds and a transaction fee of $0.004.  For comparison, Bitcoin has a speed of 10 minutes and cost of $40.  
* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? Relative to Ripple's competitors, the Ripple cryptocurrency, XRP, is currently the third most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, after Bitcoin.
## Recommendations:
* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? Instead of offering digital payments only to big banks, Ripple could also offer services to individual consumers, like Western Union and MoneyGram.  Ripple could scale down even further to apps like Venmo or PayPal.  I would suggest creating a payment card, similar to an amazon gift card, but a digital dollar backed by the Federal Government.  Currently Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards are used distribute welfare assistance for groceries, formerly known as “food stamps”.  I would recommend providing a ripple payment solution to provide assistance beyond food, such as clothing, rent, utilities, education tuition, medical care and high speed WIFI. 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? I don't see why Ripple should just focus on the large bank customers.  Ripple could increase their revenue by also meeting the needs of individual consumers.  
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? This additional service would use contactless payments within a mobile device, similar to Apple Pay or Google Wallet.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? Digital payments are playing an increasingly critical role as consumer behavior shifts into a post-COVID world where contactless is the preferred way to pay.  This digital process also allows people to send money to loved ones around the world, instantly.  Also during the pandemic, there has been a need to distribute stimulus checks and unemployment checks quickly.  Families were at risk of being homeless and hungry.  Ripple already has the technology which is safe, secure and fast.  Ripple is already accepted by some banks, so they could leverage that relationship.  No one can deny that the Federal Government needs to adopt more efficient technologies.
